Basic Question Concept 

1.Find Out Reverse of A Number :-
  first find out remainder using divide by 10 & add into new variable rev.
  sum = sum*10+remainder value
  find out Quotient using number divided by 10.

2.  Sum of Digits :-
    first find out remainder & then add into sum variable.
    find the quotient using number divided by 10.

3. Count of Digit :- 
   let assigan a variable & add value by 1 until we get quotient 0.

4. Paindrome 
  find out reverse & check with original value if equal then pass true value.

5. Factorial of the number
   take a variable fact & multiple with all number & return the value.

6. Prime of a Number 
  if number is one flag = false and when 2 return true.
  number divided by every number which is less than by given number is remainder =0 then not a prime number.

7. Find out The Missing Number :-
   first calculate the actual sum substract from getting sum.

8. Find ArmStrong Number 
  first calculate length of a number , find out the remainder value & multiply with length of number & find out sum .
  if sum = orginal value then armstrong number.

9. Find the GCD :-
   using encuildram formula = (b, a%b)

10. LCM 
    (a*b)/ gcd(a,b)

11.Perfect square Number 

Recursion : base class when function stop executing.

Array :-

1. Find out Duplicate element in array 
   take a object & array , check if a element is present in object & return else push into array .

2.Find the frequency of element in array .
  take a object & store frequencty of element .

3.Move all Zeros to End :-
  check if number is not zero then swap with right one.

4.Left/right rotate in one position 
  remove first element & add into last element of array.

5.Merge Two Sorted Array in one Array 
  check the length of array & compare one array with another one & store minimum value in array.

6.Union of the Two Array 
  take a new array & add value in to it if a elememt is not present .

7.Majority Element :
  if occurence of element is greather than the length of array divided by 2.

8. Kadane Algorithm : -
